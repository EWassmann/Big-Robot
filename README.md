# Big-Robot
this is the arduino code to run the big robot, it takes in the same commands as the small robot, so any of the code can run on either robot when hooked up
to the jetson. The robot does not like to turn as it uses skid steering and the tires are not skidding on concrete, they woud skid on gras most likeleyy
